Introduction:

This is a small Python program that is designed to help manage links. The program stores the links into a SQLite database (stored and shared on a DropBox folder-for sharing with others/remote connection).

Instructions:

1. First setup the database you want to use:
	- Go into the 'database' folder, and open the database.py file. 
	- Follow the instructions for creating the database file and creating the table for the database.
	- Run the file
2. Edit the 'menu' file:
	- Open the 'menu' file to connect to the database you just set up.
	- Also list the table you just created. 
	- Everything should be set to go!
3. Edit the read/insert files:
	- Do the same as the 'menu' file


Notes:
	- I've included a general database creator in the 'database' folder. In the event that you would want to create a separate database or use a different table. Be sure to change the files when you want to interact with a new database file.
	-Be sure to keep everything in the 'linkme' folder! 

Motivations: 
	I designed this program because I was becoming overwhelmed with the amount of data I would come across online. Between sending emails to friends, bookmarking, and posting to social networking sites, I figured there had to be a better way to manage this process. Although this technology already exist, I wanted to build something on my own (nonconformist). I also wanted to exercise both my Python and SQL skills, which was more difficult than I thought!
